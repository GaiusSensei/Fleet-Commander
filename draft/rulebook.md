# Game Overview

Fleet Commander, an Eve Online card game, is a two to six player semi-cooperative game where the players are protecting a Titan-class Ship until it jumps to the Home System. Each player is a Squad Commander in charge of a ship (or a group of ships), who are escorting the Titan. After every jump, the fleet will encounter roaming gangs, ambushes, betrayals and more as they near the Titan's home system.

After a certain number of Jumps, the player with the most points win the game.

# Key Concepts

## Golden Rule

If the card text directly contradicts a rule in the rulebook, the card text takes precedence.

## Winning the Game

After all of the event cards are resolved, each player totals his remaining points, and adds any bonus points from kills, bounties, locations and events. The player with the most number of points wins the game!

## Losing the Game

If all of the players loses all of their ships, or when the Titan-class ship loses all of it's structure, then the game ends, and all of the players lose.
